Learn GIt Branching 
Git branching allows you to create a separate line of development so you can work on new features or fix bugs without affecting the main code. It helps keep the main branch stable while changes are developed and tested independently. Once the work is complete, the branch can be merged back into the main branch.
Understand what a branch is –
a separate line of work from the main code.
